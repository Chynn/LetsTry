# LetsTry
=========

Im still unsecure in using this, so Im trying to tutor myself. I dont wanna be the black sheep in my experienced team.
So lets get started.

1. Getting used to what Github on the browser offers you.
2. Understand the meaning of using Github.
2. Try out some tutorials and make yourself comfortable with the buttons and environment.
